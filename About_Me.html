        <p class="About-Me-Para">
            Hi. I am a striving software developer from North Texas wanting to travel and learn as much as I can. I recently learned 
            about PHP, HTML, and CSS from an internship I completed this past summer at Datto Inc. I learned so much about the Linux environment and how to 
            write and test code on a massive scale. This I also have experience with C++ and a couple other languages, you can find those here. I am also 
            taking on multiple solo and group project consisting of working with a raspberry pi to learn about python and hosting a server, building an app 
            to learn about device communication, and working with multiple mechanical engineering to design a brand-new product. Going forward, I am super 
            excited to learn anything any everything I can get me hands on. More specifically, I want to gain more experience in Linux and all the different 
            versions that exist to give me a better grasp on the operating system.
        </p>
        <p class="About-Me-Para">
            As for myself, my goal is to finish traveling to the two continents I havenâ€™t been to, Africa and Antarctica. In Africa, I want to go on a 
            safari in East Africa and go fishing in Cape Town. My goal for Antarctica, is to see the Southern Lights and take on the challenging polar plunge. 
            After that, I want to see new landscapes, cultures, and try new cuisines.  Out of all the places I have traveled to so far Australia has been the 
            greatest. I had the pleasant experience to camp in the outback, see and hold koalas and kangaroos on Kangaroo Island, and visit the Sydney Opera 
            House while the orchestra was practicing.
